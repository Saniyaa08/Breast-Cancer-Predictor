Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate 
diagnosis of breast cancer are crucial for successful treatment and patient survival. In recent years, 
machine learning (ML) techniques have shown promising results in breast cancer prediction. This 
research paper aims to develop an accurate and reliable ML-based breast cancer prediction model.
The study uses data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which consists of 569 
samples with 30 features, including clinical and demographic information. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.ML algorithm, namely Logistic 
Regression, is trained on the pre-processed data to predict the occurrence of breast cancer.
The study concludes that ML-based models can accurately predict the occurrence of breast cancer and 
can potentially aid in early diagnosis and treatment.
