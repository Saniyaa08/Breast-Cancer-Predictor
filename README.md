💼🔍 Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression 🔍💼

📚 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, demanding early detection and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional methods are invasive and costly, hence the need for non-invasive approaches.

🤖 Machine learning (ML) offers promising results in healthcare, including breast cancer prediction. ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and identify hidden patterns.

🔬 This study develops an accurate and reliable ML-based breast cancer prediction model using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The dataset contains clinical and demographic information, divided into malignant and benign cases.

🔧 Data preprocessing handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. Logistic regression, a popular ML algorithm, is employed for prediction. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) selects the most important features.

📊 Results show the model achieves an accuracy of 92.6% .
🗣️ Discussion emphasizes the effectiveness of logistic regression in breast cancer prediction. Feature selection significantly improves model performance. Further research is needed to validate the model on diverse datasets.

📝 Conclusion: An accurate logistic regression-based model is developed for breast cancer prediction using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The model demonstrates high performance and feature importance. Further research is required for validation and generalizability.
