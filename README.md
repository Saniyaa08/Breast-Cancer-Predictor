Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate 
diagnosis of breast cancer are crucial for successful treatment and patient survival. In recent years, 
machine learning (ML) techniques have shown promising results in breast cancer prediction. 
The study uses data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which consists of 569 
samples with 30 features, including clinical and demographic information. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.ML algorithm, namely Logistic 
Regression, is trained on the pre-processed data to predict the occurrence of breast cancer.
The study concludes that ML-based models can accurately predict the occurrence of breast cancer and 
can potentially aid in early diagnosis and treatment.Breast cancer is a malignant tumour that develops in the breast tissue. It is the most common cancer 
among women, accounting for approximately 30% of all new cancer cases in females worldwide 
(Ferlay et al., 2015). Early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer are essential for 
successful treatment and patient survival. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as mammography and
biopsy, are invasive, time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, there is a need for accurate and reliable 
non-invasive methods for breast cancer prediction.
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data 
without being explicitly programmed. ML techniques have shown promising results in various fields, 
including healthcare. ML-based models can analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns that 
may not be visible to humans. In recent years, several studies have explored the application of ML in 
breast cancer prediction.
In this study, we aim to develop an accurate and reliable ML-based breast cancer prediction model. 
We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is a widely used dataset in breast 
cancer research. We preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. We 
train ML algorithm, namely Logistic Regression, on the preprocessed data to predict the occurrence of 
breast cancer. We evaluate the performance of the model using several metrics, including accuracy.
